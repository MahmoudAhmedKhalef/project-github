Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
 the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
 it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
 but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
 of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more 
recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
 PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
